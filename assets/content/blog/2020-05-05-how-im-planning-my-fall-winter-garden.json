I googled `Edibles by month in North Florida`, which resulted in some very helpful graphics from my local University's IFAS extension.\n\nTaking these I was able to figure out when I could start thinking about planting and some options for what to plant. Through June, my options are limited to Sweet Potatoes. Come July, I can start looking at peppers.\n\nNow that I know what's possible, I can look for specific varieties I am interested in. So I'm navigating to the [peppers category](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/peppers/) and finding what looks interesting.\n\nI'm seeing lunchbox peppers"
