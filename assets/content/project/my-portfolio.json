  "body": "I built this portfolio site to go into more depth about the projects I've worked on. At the same time, I wanted the process of creating this site to be a learning experience. Rather than grabbing a pre-built Squarespace theme I wanted to get some experience with JAMstack development.\n\nThrough the [Syntax Podcast](https://syntax.fm/show/130/the-vuejs-show-scott-teaches-wes) and [following Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) I started to learn about static site generators. The promise of speed and the ease of deploying a static site seemed like a good fit for this site.\n\nI chose Nuxt.JS as it seems to be the standard for JAMstack sites built with Vue. It paired nicely with Netlify as both a headless CMS and way of deploying the site.\n\n\n\nThis portfolio is my first JAMstack application. It turns out there are a lot of gotchas with Nuxt, so I'm glad I was able to do this project at my own pace.\n\nCheck it out on [Github](https://github.com/timmch/my-portfolio).\n\n## Technologies & Libraries\n* NuxtJS\n* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n** This project was my introduction to Tailwind CSS. I chose it to learn a new method of organizing styles. At first the list of class names in an element seemed crazy and eventually I learned to value Tailwind's approach. It made styling efficient and consistent.\n* Vuex"
